Fakemodem Driver
================

The Fakemodem sample demonstrates a simple controller-less modem driver. This driver supports sending and receiving AT commands using the `ReadFile`/`WriteFile` calls or via a TAPI interface using an application such as *HyperTerminal.*

## Universal Compliant
This sample builds a Windows Universal driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in Windows Core.
